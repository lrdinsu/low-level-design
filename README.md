Low Level Design is a collection of small Java/Maven exercises that model real‑world systems to
practice SOLID principles and common OO patterns (e.g., strategy, factory, state). Each mini‑project is self‑contained
with a simple demo and emphasizes clean entities, separation of concerns, and testability.
